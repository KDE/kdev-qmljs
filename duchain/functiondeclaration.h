 * @brief Function declaration keeping track of a "prototype" context
 *
 * The prototype of a function can be used, in Javascript, to add methods and
 * members to the objects instantiated by calling the function.
 *
 * The prototype is also used to resolve "this". If a function is assigned to
 * an object member, its "prototype" becomes the internal context of the object.
 * This way, functions assigned to members of the prototype of a class can use
 * "this" to refer to the object on which they are called.
 *
 * @code
 * function Class() { this.name = "Me"; }
 *
 * Class.prototype.print = function() { console.log(this.name) }
 * @endcode
